            <p><span>Exprole Saudi Arabia Using Google Earth: </span>Google Earth is a computer program, 
                formerly known as Keyhole EarthViewer, that renders a 3D representation 
                of Earth based primarily on satellite imagery. The program maps the Earth 
                by superimposing satellite images, aerial photography, and GIS data onto a 
                3D globe, allowing users to see cities and landscapes from various angles. 
                Users can explore the globe by entering addresses and coordinates, or by 
                using a keyboard or mouse. The program can also be downloaded on a 
                smartphone or tablet, using a touch screen or stylus to navigate. 
                Google Earth is able to show various kinds of images overlaid on 
                the surface of the earth and is also a Web Map Service client. </p>
